Super Protocol is a **confidential computing platform and AI cloud** that lets organizations run sensitive AI workloads securely on any infrastructure while keeping data, models, and code protected during execution. It provides hardware-enforced isolation, cryptographic verification of all operations, and a neutral, cloud-agnostic architecture to enable verifiable, compliant, and collaborative AI workflows without exposing raw assets.

## Core Principles

**Confidentiality**

Super isolates data within hardware-secure enclaves that no administrator, operator, or cloud provider can access, encrypts every user interaction with keys visible only to the user, and enables multi-party computation where each participant's raw information remains hidden from everyone else.

**Verifiability**

Super provides cryptographic proof of each workload's execution, enables parties to confirm results independently of the cloud provider, and generates immutable execution records that meet audit and compliance requirements

**Neutrality**

Super runs on any cloud without vendor lock-in, is built on an open and transparent foundation, and keeps organizations in full control of their infrastructure, data, and keys.

**Integrity**

Super applies the same security and execution standards across all environments, enforces consistent governance and deployment policies, and supports a scalable ecosystem where workloads run reliably from a single node to global multi-cloud networks. Together, these capabilities allow organizations to run sensitive AI, protect proprietary models and data, and collaborate across departments or companies without exposing underlying assets.

## Super Swarm

**Super Swarm** is the decentralized computing protocol that powers the Super Protocol network. It enables independent Confidential Virtual Machines to self-organize into a distributed, fault-tolerant cloud.

- Nodes automatically find, verify, and attest to each other to form clusters.
- Leader election and dynamic grouping allow tasks to scale beyond single machines.
- Entire operations are governed algorithmically, removing central control and enabling trustless coordination.

Super Swarm extends traditional cloud scaling with fault tolerance, trust minimization, and verifiable execution even across untrusted providers.
