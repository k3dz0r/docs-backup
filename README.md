## Super Protocol

Super Protocol is a **confidential computing platform and AI cloud** that lets organizations run sensitive AI workloads securely on any infrastructure while keeping data, models, and code protected during execution. It provides hardware-enforced isolation, cryptographic verification of all operations, and a neutral, cloud-agnostic architecture to enable verifiable, compliant, and collaborative AI workflows without exposing raw assets.

### Super Swarm

**Super Swarm** is the decentralized computing protocol that powers the Super Protocol network. It enables independent Confidential Virtual Machines to self-organize into a distributed, fault-tolerant cloud.

- Nodes automatically find, verify, and attest to each other to form clusters.
- Leader election and dynamic grouping allow tasks to scale beyond single machines.
- Entire operations are governed algorithmically, removing central control and enabling trustless coordination.

Super Swarm extends traditional cloud scaling with fault tolerance, trust minimization, and verifiable execution even across untrusted providers.
