Super Protocol is a **confidential computing platform and AI cloud** that lets organizations run sensitive AI workloads securely on any infrastructure while keeping data, models, and code protected during execution. It provides hardware-enforced isolation, cryptographic verification of all operations, and a neutral, cloud-agnostic architecture to enable verifiable, compliant, and collaborative AI workflows without exposing raw assets. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What We Do

- **Confidential AI & Data Protection**  
  Protect workloads in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) so data stays private even while it’s being processed. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **Verifiable Execution**  
  Generate cryptographic proof of how AI tasks ran, helping meet audit, compliance, and governance requirements. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

- **Neutral, Decentralized Architecture**  
  Run AI across clouds, partners, and teams without vendor lock-in or shared infrastructure trust. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 🐝 Super Swarm

**Super Swarm** is the decentralized computing protocol that powers the Super Protocol network. It enables independent Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) to *self-organize into a distributed, fault-tolerant cloud*. Swarm nodes automatically discover and verify each other, elect leaders, and form task groups. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

This approach brings *confidential, verifiable, and unstoppable* cloud computing to a global, peer-to-peer network of participants. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
